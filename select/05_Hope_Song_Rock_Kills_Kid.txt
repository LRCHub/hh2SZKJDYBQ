The rain drops, pour off the roof again
They fall down, down, down upon me
I won? t let it get me down
There? s something for me here
I? m gonna give it one more try

Because I gave it all away
And I'm still standing
Threw my world away
I'm still standing
And I gave it all away
And I? m still standing

In the sky I feel, I feel disaster
Coming towards me
I won? t let it get me down
There? s so much life to live
I? m gonna give it one more try

Because I gave it all away
And I? m still standing
Threw my world away
I? m still standing
And I gave it all away
I? m still standing

The rain drops fall down

Because I gave it all away
And I'm still standing
Threw my world away
And I? m still standing

Sing me a hope song
And I'll sing with you
? Cause I gave it all away
And I? m still standing

I gave it all away
I gave it all away
I gave it all away
I gave it all away
