In over our heads
Ahead of ourselves
Force fed to something we don't see
Crazier each day
As higher gets
The climb, the climb

Maybe the future
Has us in pieces
Maybe it's worth what we lose
So faster we go
Harder we make
The try, the try, the try

Leading your whole heart
Show me to reach far
Farther than I thought we could see
Living for the thing
Echoes beyond
This life, this life

Making up the world
Unfolding ourselves
We could go forever unseen
Still forward we go
Harder we make
The try, the try, the try

Maybe we move up
Flyer than ourselves
Maybe we are blind but we're free
So faster we go
Never give up
The try, the try, the try
