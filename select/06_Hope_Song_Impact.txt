If the moon haunts me by night
And the sun gives no respite
Creator of the stars
My only hope is You

If tears stream down my face
And my steps are all misplaced
Creator of the earth
My only hope is You

I lift up my eyes
To the mountains heights
You alone are God
To You, my song will rise

You're my strength alone
And You're my restoration
My hope is in You

If my heart comes to despair
And my soul downcast with cares
Creator of all life
My only hope is You

I lift up my eyes
To the mountains heights
You alone are God
To You, my song will rise

You're my strength alone
And You're my restoration
My hope is in You
Forever, You're my shelter
Constant, my defender
My hope is in You

Your victory is my hope
Your way, my trusted road
Your cross, my hiding place
It's all in You, God
Your victory is my hope
Your way, my trusted road
Your cross, my hiding place
It's all in You, God

Your victory is my hope
Your way, my trusted road
Your cross, my hiding place
It's all in You, God
Your victory is my hope
Your way, my trusted road
Your cross, my hiding place
It's all in You, God
Your victory is my hope
Your way, my trusted road
Your cross, my hiding place
It's all in You, God
Your victory is my hope
Your way, my trusted road
Your cross, my hiding place
It's all in You, God
